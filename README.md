# GAN

Repository for GANs (families of generative adversarial network) by Keras (tensorflow)

## requires

- Keras (2.3.1)
- Tensorflow (1.14.0)
- Numpy (1.16.4)
- matplotlib (3.1.0)

All the scripts are refering to https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN . I modified them for explaining the function of the models in detail. Full description is shown in qiita website (but sorry in Japanese).
